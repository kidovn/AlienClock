# Alien Clock
 - Display the Alien clock (be creative) showing current date and time The clock should be updated every 1 Alien second.  (first Clock)
 - Allow user to set date and time. Validate the input.
 - Display Earth’s date and time based on the Alien’s time. (second Clock)
 - Allow user to set alarm. ( Just one time alarm base Earth Clock )

Problem:
- Not yet implement Alien Calendar, so I hack current Georgian
- Not yet implement recurring Alarm
- Not yet implement Alarm base Alien Clock
- Not yet handle alarm after Ring Ring
- Not yet handle alarm when reboot phone


NOTE: the testing content have one problem at section 1: Month 18 does not have day 51, max is 38. So I set it to 31
